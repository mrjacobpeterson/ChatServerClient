This was all new to me. I didn't know a thing about programming with TCP or threading. I did some research, then some more, and then made a mistake of studying a C# chat client someone else has posted. It was all making sense and I was taking it all in and then when I went to program it, all that popped into my head on how to structure it was the post I had read. All of the code within is my own, but the structure is heavily inspired from the post I read. It would've taken too much time and effort to write out the whole program but in a consciously completely different way than I had read about. 

I hope that explanation makes sense and doesn't affect how my answer to this challenge is perceived. I learned a lot in doing this and look forward to explaining it!

How to run:

(I attempted to export to a single file, but it came out to 132MB for the client, so Github wouldn't let me upload it)

- download the project

- navigate to => chatServer => chatServer => bin => Debug => net6.0 => chatServer.exe

- navigate to => chatClient => chatClient => bin => Debug => net6.0-windows => chatClient.exe

- the client is simple, just enter a username and click Login

- start up another client

- send a message, it'll be broadcast out to all clients
